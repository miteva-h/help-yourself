# Help Yourself

This is a high value prototype, made as a homework for the subject Human-computer interaction design. The main idea is to help users when they feel emotionally down by reading some articles on those topics, examining the cause of the problem, writing a diary to track their progress.

Spring Boot + Thymeleaf is used for the purposes of the subject, without any database(so the user can login, for ex. with username='user1' and password='pass1' ).
